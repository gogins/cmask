=============================
ChangeLog for CMask on GitHub
=============================

To recompile:
	cd to the source/ directory.
	make


2016-10-26  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

	New files:
		.gitignore
		ChangeLog.txt
		Issues.txt
		testfiles/run-tests.sh

2016-07-14  Steven Yi

	Updated to compile with newer C++ compilers:
		1. "#include <iostream.h>" has been updated to "#include <iostream>"
		2. "using namespace std;" has been added to globals.h
		3. D_IRIX is defined for the build in globals.h, making the build 
		   suitable for Linux.  Users compiling cmask for other platforms will
		   have to change what platform is defined in globals.h. 

------------------------------------------------------------
The changes below were committed to GitHub on 2016-10-26:

2013-06-13  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

	mask.cpp:
	mask.h:
	parser.cpp:
	parser.h:
	utils.cpp:
	utils.h:
		Changed some params & vars to eliminate warnings about string constants.

	cmask.cpp:
		Added output messages labeling this as a modified version and including
		the date of compilation.

2013-06-12  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

	*.cpp:
		Change header style to match standard C++ (#include <stdio.h> to 
		<cstdio>, etc.) and include "globals.h" after standard headers instead
		of before.
		
	parser.cpp:
		Set errno = 0 before calling strtod() to avoid incorrectly reporting
		errors on recent OS X systems.

	windows-crosscc.make:
		Copy of makefile with changes so that I can compile a Windows .exe on
		Mac OS X.

2009-04-19  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

	globals.h:  New macro MAX_FILENAME; set to 2048.

	cmask.cpp:
	parser.h:
	fileio.h:
	fileio.cpp:  Most filename char[] variables were only 32 or 33
		bytes long which was easy to overflow and crash.  Replaced
		explicit sizes with MAX_FILENAME macro.

2007-03-15  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

  I had to make a couple small changes to make this compile on MacOS X:

	globals.h:  comment out #define D_MAC and uncomment #define D_IRIX.

	parser.h/cpp:  rename "isnumber" function to "myisnumber" due to a 
		conflict with the OS X ctype.h header.
